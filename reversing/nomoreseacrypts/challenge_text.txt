QwarkSoft was recently impacted by a multi-stage ransomware that encrypted one of their important source code files and destroyed all backups of the file. While the file could not be recovered, a forensics team have managed to recover the executable responsible for encrypting the source code file as well as a file believed to be an encrypted version of the original source code file. All efforts to decrypt the file have failed. You have been recommended to us by a trusted partner who believes you have what it takes to decrypt the file. Can you succceed where others have failed?
